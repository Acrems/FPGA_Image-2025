Week 1: Ubuntu 22 setup, ROS basics
Week 2: STM32 basics and integrating with ROS
Week 3: Interfacing flex sensors and creating a data pipeline, along with initial prototype development
Week 4: Introduction to CAD and URDF files; building a simulated hand model
Week 5: Interfacing the simulation with STM32 and introduction to Pure Data (PD)
Week 6: Using Pure Data to create MIDI control with flex sensors
Week 7: Finalizing the product and testing
Week 8: Documentation and project evaluation
